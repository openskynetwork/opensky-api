      |  **origin_country** - inferred through the ICAO24 address
      |  **time_position** - seconds since epoch of last position report. Can be None if there was no position report received by OpenSky within 15s before.

      |  **true_track** - in decimal degrees (0 is north). Can be None if information not present.
      |  **vertical_rate** - in m/s, incline is positive, decline negative. Can be None if information not present.
      |  **sensors** - serial numbers of sensors which received messages from the vehicle within the validity period of this state vector. Can be None if no filtering for sensor has been requested.
      |  **baro_altitude** - barometric altitude in meters. Can be None
      |  **squawk** - transponder code aka Squawk. Can be None
